After the German Revolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919) The house of Hohenzollern, their supporters, a part of the navy, and a large part of the army escaped to Namibia which was German SÃ¼dwestafrika. Unfortunately, Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd suffered a stroke and died in 1922 leaving either Wilhelm the 3rd or Victoria Louise as his successor due to modernised succession laws. During the Great war the Boers rebelled once more, and with German support, defeated the British South Africans making Transvaal state. Wilhelm the 3rd who commanded German forces in Transvaal, was immensely popular and in 1924 invited to take leadership of the country due to political instability, therefore making Transvaal into a Personal Union/Dominion of New Prussia. The African situation in 1936 is that Communist support in both Transvaal and Namibia is rising, due to the USSR sending massive amounts of support to the natives who are growing more discontented each passing day.
